# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables course administrators to have a simple and intuitive interface for managing user course stream assignments. Administrators need the ability to select users from the existing user list and modify their assigned course stream efficiently. This functionality is critical for managing student transfers between different course streams (3rd, 4th, 5th stream) and ensuring proper course organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a course administrator, I want to select a user from the user list and change their course stream, so that I can efficiently manage student transfers and course organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator views the user list THEN the system SHALL display all users with their current stream information
2. WHEN an administrator clicks on a user in the list THEN the system SHALL provide an option to edit the user's stream
3. WHEN an administrator selects a new stream for a user THEN the system SHALL update the user's stream assignment in the database
4. WHEN a stream change is completed THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
5. WHEN a stream change fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a course administrator, I want the stream editing interface to be simple and intuitive, so that I can make changes quickly without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the stream editing interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the current stream clearly
2. WHEN selecting a new stream THEN the system SHALL provide a dropdown or selection interface with available streams
3. WHEN making a stream change THEN the system SHALL require confirmation before applying the change
4. WHEN the interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the user's name and relevant identification information
5. IF the user has bookings or course history THEN the system SHALL display a warning about potential impacts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a course administrator, I want to see immediate feedback when I change a user's stream, so that I can verify the change was successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stream change is submitted THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
2. WHEN the change is successful THEN the system SHALL update the user list to reflect the new stream
3. WHEN viewing the updated user THEN the system SHALL display the new stream information
4. IF the change affects user bookings THEN the system SHALL indicate what related data was updated
5. WHEN multiple administrators are using the system THEN the system SHALL reflect changes made by others in real-time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a course administrator, I want to have proper validation and error handling when changing streams, so that I don't accidentally create data inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a new stream THEN the system SHALL validate that the stream exists and is active
2. IF a user has active bookings in their current stream THEN the system SHALL warn about potential conflicts
3. WHEN a database error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
4. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL indicate the connection status
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent the change and explain the issue
