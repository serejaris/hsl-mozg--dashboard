## Manual Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] "Поток" button appears in user list actions column
- [ ] Clicking button opens StreamChangeDialog
- [ ] Dialog shows current stream correctly
- [ ] Dropdown contains all available streams (3rd, 4th, 5th)
- [ ] Save button updates database and closes dialog
- [ ] Cancel button closes dialog without changes
- [ ] User list refreshes to show new stream after update

### Validation & Error Handling
- [ ] Cannot select same stream as current (shows error)
- [ ] Must select a stream before saving (shows error)
- [ ] Users with no active bookings show appropriate error
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Success message appears after successful update

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Users with no assigned stream show warning
- [ ] Users with multiple bookings update most recent active one
- [ ] Users with only cancelled bookings show error
- [ ] Invalid stream values are rejected by API

## Expected Behavior

1. **Happy Path**: Administrator clicks "Поток" → selects new stream → clicks save → sees success message → user list shows updated stream

2. **Error Cases**: Proper error messages for validation failures, no active bookings, network issues

3. **UI Updates**: Immediate feedback, loading states, and list refresh after changes
